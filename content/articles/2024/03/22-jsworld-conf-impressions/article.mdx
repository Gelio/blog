  Here is how JSWorld Conference 2024 in Amsterdam looked like from my
  perspective.
---

Thanks to [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/) for sponsoring my trip to
[the JSWorld Conference 2024](https://jsworldconference.com/). The conference
took place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, between 2024-02-28 and 2024-03-01.

## Initial confusion

There were a couple confusing parts about the conference itself.

First, it turned out, that the _JSWorld Conference_ was a composition of
[the VueJS Amsterdam 2024 conference](https://vuejs.amsterdam/) (first 2 days),
and the final day was the 2nd day of
[the DevWorld Conference 2024](https://devworldconference.com/). I was confused,
since it did not say on the JSWorld Conference website that it consists of parts
of other conferences. When I arrived at the venue, I was unsure whether I am at
the right place, since it did not say _JSWorld_ anywhere, but it said _VueJS_.
Thankfully, my name was in the list of attendees, so I was able to get in.

Additionally, before the conference started, I had to _activate my ticket_,
which involved going through some checkout page and "purchasing" a free ticket
there. Not sure why that was necessary, since I had already bought my ticket way
in advance.

## VueJS Amsterdam 2024 (Days 1-2)

The first two days were dedicated to VueJS. I am not a VueJS developer and I
have never built anything with it. I accepted it as an opportunity to compare
React and VueJS, and also learn about the framework-agnostic parts that were
mentioned during the conference.

I enjoyed the fact that it was a single-track conference. It was held at the
Theater Amsterdam, which featured a huge screen and a great sound system. The
only difficult part was getting in and out of seats, since they were long rows.
The organizers also waited for the long queue in front of the building to check
in before starting the conference, which was nice of them. I didn't want to miss
Evan You's keynote.

Here are my takeaways from the conference talks:

- In _PrimeVue | The Next-Gen UI Component Library_, Cagatay Civici talked about
  their use of design tokens in the library, and specifically making the
  distinction between primitive, semantic, and component tokens.

  Examples, using CSS variables:

  - primitive: `--red-500: #ef4444`
  - semantic: `--color-danger: var(--red-500)`
  - component: `--button-color: var(--color-danger)`

  Each layer uses tokens from the previous layer. It seems like an elegant way
  to compose those tokens.

  Such a distinction of tokens is also mentioned in
  [Figma help articles](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/18490793776023-Update-1-Tokens-variables-and-styles#token-organization).

- Through _Rendering Revealed_ by Adam Jahr, I found out that Nuxt is getting
  [islands](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-island) _of
  non-interactivity_.

  They seem similar to
  [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/), but rather
  than opting-in to interactivity, Nuxt islands opt-out of it.

- Thanks to _Common Mistakes in Vue.js_ by Daniel Kelly, I learned that Nuxt has
  a [`useState`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-state) composable.
  Despite the name similarity, it works nowhere near the same as the React hook.

  `useState` in Nuxt is a composable (basically a React hook, as far as I know)
  that allows you to declare the state on the server, and then send it to the
  client for later use.

- In _Vue & Vite Devtools_, Guillaume Chau explained that
  [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/) powers Vue language server ability to understand
  embedded languages (e.g. providing JavaScript suggestions inside a `script`
  tag in an HTML file, despite the fact that an HTML file is not a JavaScript
  file).

- In the same talk, Guillaume showcased how easy it was to new developer tooling
  to Vue using Vue devtool kit.
  [Looks like the devtool kit is still in progress](https://github.com/vuejs/devtools-next/issues/71),
  but it was cool to see new dev tools tailored to a specific application.

- In _Cost-Effective Testing with Storybook and Playwright in Vue Applications_,
  Yauheni Prakopchyk recommended using Storybook for more than showcasing
  components. Stories are also useful to run
  [interaction tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/interaction-testing)
  (basically `@testing-library` that run in the browser instead of JSDOM) and
  [visual tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/visual-testing)
  (finding visual changes in stories from one run to another).

## DevWorld Conference 2024 (Day 3)

The last day was also the last day of the DevWorld Conference. There were 5
tracks (1 main stage, 4 duck stages) with a variety of topics. I could attend
whichever talks I wanted and I was not confined to just JavaScript talks, which
was nice.

The venue (RAI Amsterdam) was huge. There were also a lot more people there than
at the VueJS Conference.

Unfortunately, this day felt way worse to the VueJS part:

- To listen to the duck stage talks, you has to wear headphones. There were not
  enough headphones for everyone, since there was not too much seat rotation
  (most people just stayed at one stage). I usually stood in the background and
  tried to pick up what the talk is about from the slides and the low volume of
  audio played from the speakers of the audio technical crew.

- Food and beverages were not free. I am mostly surprised by this part, since
  the conference ticket was not cheap. At least there was free water.

- I had to wait in line for around 40 minutes to receive my badge to get in.

- They ran out of attendee swag-bags, so I didn't get one. I only got a beanie,
  which is definitely better than nothing, but still a bit disappointing.

Anyways, here are the interesting bits from these talks:

- In _JavaScript Streaming - A Qwik glimpse into the future_ by Shai Reznik, I
  found out that Qwik has a different approach to hydration - it uses
  _resumability_. Instead of rerunning all the components again on the client to
  attach event handlers, it looks at the server-rendered DOM and infers stuff
  from it, effectively "resuming" where the server stopped. It implements
  [the PRPL pattern](https://web.dev/articles/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl).

- Through _Latest in Angular by Angular Team Member_ by _Minko Gechev_, I
  learned that [Angular adopted signals](https://angular.io/guide/signals). That
  is yet another framework (next to
  [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/),
  [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_signals),
  [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/state/#usesignal)) that uses this
  state primitive.

  I have not used Angular for a long time, but I bet signals are going to be
  simpler to work with compared to [RxJS observables](https://rxjs.dev/).

- In _Tauri 2.0_, Daniel Thompson-Yvetot talked more about
  [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - a Rust-based Electron alternative for building
  standalone applications for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.

  According to Daniel, The binaries it produces are way smaller than Electron,
  since Tauri does not ship its own webview and uses the one provided by the
  operating system. It also heavily tree-shakes code and unused features.

  An interesting part was that Tauri has external security audits for major
  releases.

- In _SolidJS - SolidStart_, Ryan Carniato presented
  [server actions in Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/core-concepts/actions).

  They seem similar to React's server actions.

  One cool feature is that the framework is smart about their response - if a
  server action ends with a redirect, the HTTP response includes some resources
  that are going to be needed on that destination page.

- Ryan Dahl showcased [JSR](https://jsr.io/) (a new module registry).

  Notable features of JSR:

  - TypeScript support (you can upload TypeScript files there and it will take
    care of the compilation - cool for getting started, but I can foresee some
    hard-to-debug issues since the engineer is not controlling the `tsc`
    compilation).
  - Only ESM - a step forward in getting rid of CommonJS modules.
  - Interoperability with npm (packages on JSR can use npm packages as
    dependencies, and npm packages can import JSR packages).
  - Generates documentation based on TypeScript types and JSDoc. The
    documentation is available right there
    [when browsing the registry](https://jsr.io/@oak/oak).

  - Provides a score for packages and suggests best practices to maintainers.

- In _All Things Astro_, Elian van Cutsem View presented 3 cool Astro features
  that stood out to me:

  - Easy-to-enable
    [view transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/).

    It uses a polyfill to enable view transitions in browsers that do not
    support them yet (at the time of writing this post,
    [Firefox and Safari do not support them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API#browser_compatibility)).

    One thing I didn't realize is that view transitions are are shown in
    [the Animations tab in Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/animations),
    which makes them easy to inspect and control their speed.

  - [Page partials](https://astro.build/blog/astro-340/), which render just some
    parts of the page's HTML. This works great with [htmx](https://htmx.org/),
    which relies on the server returning just the parts of the DOM that should
    be updated/inserted.

  - [Astro Studio](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/studio/), which makes it
    easy to spin up a new SQL database for an Astro project. It has built-in
    migrations, and a type-safe ORM.

## Amsterdam as a city

This was my first time visiting Amsterdam. I was surprised by how many bikes are
there, and the fact that they dominate the streets. It was nothing like I have
experienced before in capitals, where all parts of the city are full of cars.

I didn't have any trouble getting around the city, or from the airport to the
hotel. The public transport was great, and the city is very walkable. Everyone I
talked to knew English, so I didn't have any trouble communicating.

The city is also very clean, and the architecture is beautiful. I enjoyed
walking around the canals and seeing the old buildings, most of them no taller
than 5 floors.

Exploring Amsterdam was an amazing addition to the conference experience.

## Conclusion

The conference was a great experience. I learned a lot about VueJS and other
tools in the frontend ecosystem. It was also interesting to meet the famous
people that stand behind these great tools and frameworks, and that I only knew
from their GitHub contributions and blog articles.
