title: Neovim highlights are extmarks

summary:
  While trying to contribute to
  [nvim-ts-rainbow](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow) I discovered that
  _highlights_ in Neovim are implemented using _extmarks_.
---

TL;DR:
[`vim.highlight.range()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.highlight.range()>)
and
[`vim.api.nvim_buf_add_highlight()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_buf_add_highlight()>)
are implemented by using
[extmarks](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#extmarks). I did not find this
information in the Neovim docs and it took me an hour to make this connection.
[Proof](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/feba56af7d032c948a78c21735502bebe45f8361/src/nvim/api/extmark.c#L907).

[nvim-ts-rainbow](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow) is a great Neovim
plugin that highlights matching parentheses in matching colors. Nested
parentheses are highlighted in a different way, so it looks like a rainbow (or
whatever colors you configure) in the end.

It has also a notion of an `extended_mode` that also highlights JSX tag names.
This makes the following code:

```tsx
<StyledArticleCardContainer className={className} as="article">
  <StyledArticleCardTitle as={titleAs}>{title}</StyledArticleCardTitle>

  <ArticleMeta
    readingTimeMin={readingTimeMin}
    createdDate={createdDate}
    tagNames={tagNames}
  />

  <div>{summary}</div>

  <Link href={getArticlePagePath(slug)} passHref>
    <Button>Read more</Button>
  </Link>
</StyledArticleCardContainer>
```

be highlighted in the following way:

![Screenshot of the prior JSX code with matching JSX tag names highlighted using
the same color. Tags on different levels of nesting are highlighted in different
colors](/static-content/2022/08/08-neovim-highlights-are-extmarks/jsx-rainbow-highlight.png)

## The bug

There was
[one particular `nvim-ts-rainbow` bug](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/issues/118)
that irritated me for some time. The problem was that with `extended_mode`
enabled, the rainbow highlight would include not only the JSX tag names and the
angle brackets, but also the props. In other words, instead of the expected
highlight, the code looked like this:

![Screenshot of that same code from earlier. JSX is highlighted in rainbow
colors but the highlight includes the props. JSX self-closing elements are not
highlighted at
all.](/static-content/2022/08/08-neovim-highlights-are-extmarks/bug-jsx-props-are-highlighted.png)

Notice that the props of JSX elements are highlighted in the same way tag names
are. This makes them easy to spot, but we lose information this way. For
example, notice that `getArticlePagePath` is highlighted in green on the first
screenshot, making it stand out more, since it is a function that is called. it
does not stand out as much in the second screenshot.

Moreover, JSX self-closing elements (`ArticleMeta` in this case) is not
highlighted by `nvim-ts-rainbow` at all.

### The solution

In case the bug description interested you and you would like to see the fix, it
is in [this PR](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/pull/125).

The solution involved rewriting some
[treesitter queries](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries)
to only capture JSX tag names and not the entire tags.

## Accessing Neovim highlights programmatically

After fixing that bug I wanted to add some tests to make sure the highlights are
correct. This meant accessing the highlights programmatically.

I knew that
[nvim-ts-rainbow added the highlights using `vim.highlight.range`](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/blob/d16220f825c0521586499fac340b8a5c8b7117b0/lua/rainbow/internal.lua#L85-L96).
I had no clue how to then access these highlights. I looked through
[`:h vim.highlight.range`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.highlight.range()>)
and
[`:h nvim_buf_add_highlight`](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/blob/d16220f825c0521586499fac340b8a5c8b7117b0/lua/rainbow/internal.lua#L85-L96)
but I did not find any functions that would return the highlights.

Only after I read
[the source code of `nvim_buf_add_highlight`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/feba56af7d032c948a78c21735502bebe45f8361/src/nvim/api/extmark.c#L907)
I understood that Neovim highlights are implemented using _extmarks_, which are
well documented ([`:h extmarks`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#extmarks))
and easy to access programmatically
([`:h nvim_buf_get_extmarks()`](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_buf_get_extmarks()>)).

Equipped with this information, I was able to
[implement automated tests for `nvim-ts-rainbow` highlighting](https://github.com/p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/pull/127).

## Conclusion

If anyone is looking for a way to programmatically access Neovim highlights
defined with `vim.highlight.range` or `nvim_buf_add_highlight`: highlights are
implemented with extmarks. Use `nvim_buf_get_extmarks` to get extmarks
(highlights) defined within a given range.
