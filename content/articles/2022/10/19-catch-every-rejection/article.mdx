summary:
  In Node.js, omitting catching a rejection in at least one Promise chain leads
  to an `unhandledRejection` event and the process being usually killed.
---

Consider the following source code:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

promise.finally(() => {
  console.log("finally runs");
});

promise.then(
  () => {
    console.log("Promise resolved");
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Error caught");
  }
);
```

If you run the following code in Node.js, the result will be the following (at
least on versions v16.13.1, v16.18.0, and v19.0.0):

```sh
$ node test.js
finally runs
Error caught
/home/voreny/projects/blog/test/test.js:1
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));
                               ^

Error: Rejected
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/voreny/projects/blog/test/test.js:1:32)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1159:14)
    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1213:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1037:32)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:878:12)
    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:82:12)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:23:47
```

I was surprised by this behavior. I thought I caught the rejection by providing
the second callback to `then` (the one that prints `Error caught`). Refactoring
the second callback of `then` to a standalone `catch`
(`promise.then(...).catch(...)`) does not help. What surprised me is that in
this case, the process exits, which we can observe by adding a delayed
`console.log`:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

promise.finally(() => {
  console.log("finally runs");
});

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Promise resolved");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error caught");
  });

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 500);
```

The output is still the same. No sign of `Timeout` being printed in the console.
The process exits right away:

```sh
$ time node test.js
finally runs
Error caught
/home/voreny/projects/blog/test/test.js:1
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));
                               ^

```

## Unhandled rejections

What we just observed is how Node.js reacts to _unhandled Promise rejections_.
When a Promise chain ends with a rejection that was not caught, Node.js emits
[the `unhandledRejection` event](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/process.html#event-unhandledrejection).

We can register a handler for that event:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

process.on("unhandledRejection", (error) => {
  console.log("Got unhandled rejection", error);
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 500);
```

Just as like
[in physics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)>), the
observation alters the outcome. Just because we registered an event handler for
these unhandled rejections, the process no longer exits and `Timeout` is printed
in the console:

```sh
$ time node test.js
Got unhandled rejection Error: Rejected
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/voreny/projects/blog/test/test.js:1:32)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1159:14)
    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1213:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1037:32)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:878:12)
    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:82:12)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:23:47
Timeout

real    0m0,532s
user    0m0,032s
sys     0m0,004s
```

## Handling rejections in each Promise chain

Coming back to the example from the beginning of the article, let's attach a
handler for `unhandledRejection`s:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

promise.finally(() => {
  console.log("finally runs");
});

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Promise resolved");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error caught");
  });

process.on("unhandledRejection", (error) => {
  console.log("Got unhandled rejection", error);
});
```

```sh
$ node test.js
finally runs
Error caught
Got unhandled rejection Error: Rejected
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/voreny/projects/blog/test/test.js:1:32)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1159:14)
    at Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1213:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1037:32)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:878:12)
    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:82:12)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:23:47
```

This shows exactly that despite having a `catch` in the second Promise chain,
there is still an unhandled rejection in the first Promise chain (the one with a
sole `finally`).

Attaching a `catch` in the first Promise chain makes the unhandled rejection
event go away:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

promise
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("finally runs");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error also caught in first chain");
  });

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Promise resolved");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error caught");
  });

process.on("unhandledRejection", (error) => {
  console.log("Got unhandled rejection", error);
});
```

```bash
$ node test.js
finally runs
Error caught
Error also caught in first chain
```

## Real-life example

I encountered this behavior when trying to mix Promises and
[Node.js Streams](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/stream.html). I
wanted to use the asynchronous version of
[`pipeline`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/stream.html#streampipelinestreams-callback)
and remove event listeners at the end of the pipeline, regardless of whether it
was successful or not. The code looked like this:

```typescript
const pipelineWithoutDestroyingSource = (
  sourceStream: Readable,
  transforms: Transform[]
) => {
  const newSource = new Duplex();
  sourceStream.pipe(newSource);
  const pipelinePromise = pipeline(newSource, ...transforms);
  pipelinePromise.finally(() => {
    sourceStream.unpipe(newSource);
  });

  return pipelinePromise;
};

// in some other place
try {
  await pipelineWithoutDestroyingSource(/* ... */);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Could not complete the pipeline", error);
}
```

Note that this code is missing error handling and may not work. It is just to
show the use of promises.

This snippet creates a new Promise chain that does not have any rejection
handlers. Even though the rejection is caught in the `try` block, this is just
the rejection in one Promise chain. The other Promise chain inside of
`pipelineWithoutDestroyingSource` is still there and will trigger
`unhandledRejection` events. This will end up exiting the process.

## Unhandled rejections in the browser

Unhandled rejections behave the same way in the browser. If we take the code
from the beginning of the article and run it in Chrome or Firefox (these are the
browsers I checked), we get an error log about an _Uncaught (in promise) Error_.

It is not as destructive as in Node.js and an unhandled rejection does not kill
the browser tab. Registered timeouts and other asynchronous events continue to
run:

```typescript
const promise = Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"));

promise.finally(() => {
  console.log("finally runs");
});

promise
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Promise resolved");
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("Error caught");
  });

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 500);
```

![Firefox console with the result of execution of the snippet above. There is an unhandled rejection and then there is a log line from the timeout.](/static-content/2022/10/19-catch-every-rejection/firefox-rejection-timeout.png)

## Summary

The requirement to handle rejections in every Promise chain seems to hold up in
the browser and Node.js. The former leaves extra information in the console but
seems otherwise harmless. The latter leads to the process being killed
unexpectedly, unless a handler for `unhandledRejection` events is registered.

Catching the rejection once, in one Promise chain, does not mean that the
rejection is handled in other chains. The rejection must be handled in each
Promise chain (`.then`, `.finally`) to consdier it handled.

The safe thing to do is to always `.catch` errors before a `.finally` when the
intention is to do some cleanup regardless of the process resolution.
