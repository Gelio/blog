summary:
  JavaScript `Promise`'s `then` function offers extra convenience. Is it
  harmful, though?
---

The introduction of `Promise`s in JavaScript was a great usability improvement
when working with asynchronous code. They are usually much easier to comprehend
compared to callbacks (see [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/)). It is not
a new concept, though. Other languages have similar abstraction to handle
asynchronous computations that eventually return a value:
[Rust has Futures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html),
[so does C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future),
[C# has Tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task-1?view=net-6.0),
and
[so do many other languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises#List_of_concepts_related_to_futures_and_promises_by_programming_language).

I will explore how the JavaScript implementation of Promise-chaining has an
extra functionality that seems like a convenience, but proves difficult to work
with in some cases, for example [zx scripts](https://github.com/google/zx). This
makes `Promise` diverge from the monad definition.

## Chaining Promises

Naturally, `Promise`s can be chained using
[the `then` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then).

```typescript
function getRandomInteger() {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * 50);
}

function delay(ms: number): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

function getDelayedRandomInteger(): Promise<number> {
  return delay(1000).then(getRandomInteger);
}

// Print a random integer (multiplied by 2) after one second
getDelayedRandomInteger()
  .then((integer) => integer * 2)
  .then(console.log);
```

If we break it down into steps, it could look like so:

```typescript
const randomIntegerPromise = getDelayedRandomInteger();
const doubledRandomIntegerPromise = randomIntegerPromise.then((value) => {
  return value * 2;
});
doubledRandomIntegerPromise.then(console.log);
```

Looking at this syntax and ignoring other knowledge I have about the behavior of
`then`, I can conclude that the callback provided to `then` will receive the
value of the `Promise` it is attached to. Whatever the callback returns will be
the value the final `Promise` resolves with.

To be concrete, `randomIntegerPromise` will resolve with some random integer,
which will be passed as an argument (`value`) to the arrow function which
returns the doubled value. That doubled value will be the value
`doubledRandomIntegerPromise` resolves with.

All good so far. What if we wanted to chain another asynchronous operation?
Let's use that random integer as a person ID and get that person details from
[the Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

```typescript
getDelayedRandomInteger()
  .then((id) => fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${id}`))
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

A point for you if you noticed we are using the same `then` method to chain
promises but now the function returns asynchronous operations, aka `Promise`s
(both `fetch` and `response.json()` return `Promise`s).

It still works, though. You can
[try it in the TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAcwKZQEoEMwBM4C2AkmFKmgE4AUAlIgN4BQiiF6IFSAsllABYA6CnHC4qPfkJz4CtRACpEAVgAMNANyMAvo0ahIsBIlyoANlgCeVAgGcAXIjAgCAI1QUaDgArCCMG6gAPABucDC4AHwMzKzsnI6oAO6IPoT+qFRUbDZwpsGodAC8UQFQACowBKgiUFmoOXmoADSItjQa2rr60PBIaFAAImaWqLjYeIQkZJS03r7pgU6u7lFMLGxQHEgm5lYAjCqHNAL8qGBU-eMyU+TuHTqM-UO7o1eTpLfUNDEnfGeZ4SKUWA6AgfCoAAM+FAoAAHewAegRNkSWFhMAEJmCCLRMARsOqsNMqARABJ6OEtBD2j9Tuc6jZYQgAkDYozmagBAArHLnGksX7-CDM3Kc0xwZAaIA).

What is _convenient_ (or _weird_, depending on your preference) is that the type
of `myPromise` in the following snippet is not `Promise<Promise<Response>>`, but
just `Promise<Response>`.

```typescript
const responsePromise: Promise<Response> = getDelayedRandomInteger().then(
  (id) => fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${id}`)
);
```

`then` accepts functions that return both synchronous values **and** `Promise`s.
If the function returns a `Promise`, the outer `Promise` will resolve with that
returned `Promise` value. If it returns a synchronous value, that value will be
used as the final value.

It may seem a bit magical at first and seems convenient at first. It is not
concerning as long as you are not actually interested in having access to the
inner `Promise` from the outside. In other words, if you do not care about the
final type actually being `Promise<Promise<...>>`, you can live a happy life
appreciating the convenience of the overloaded `then` method. What if you need
that inner promise?

## Processes as promises in `zx`

[zx](https://github.com/google/zx) is a great tool for writing scripts in
JavaScript/TypeScript. I use it in favor of Bash scripts and appreciate how easy
it is to read and refactor them.

When using `zx`, the primary way to run other processes is to use the `$` tagged
template literal. It returns a `Promise` that resolves with an object containing
the output of the process.

```typescript
import { $ } from "zx";

const echoProcess = $`echo "Hello world"`;
echoProcess.then(({ exitCode }) => console.log("Finished with", exitCode));
```

```sh
10:22 $ npx zx test.mjs
$ echo "Hello world"
Hello world
Finished with 0
```

## Background tasks in zx

In some cases, we want to start a process and run it in the background while our
`zx` script runs some other tasks. This happened to me when I wanted to start
[a `postgres` Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and keep it
running in the background while the script leverages it later. Starting a Docker
container takes a moment (especially when the image has to be pulled for the
first time), so the script should wait for the container to be running before it
continues.

The script could look like this (parts omitted for brevity):

```typescript
const containerName = "postgres";

const waitForContainerToBeReady = () =>
  $`docker inspect -f '{{.State.Status}}' ${containerName}`.then(({ stdout }) =>
    stdout.trim() === "running" ? undefined : waitForContainerToBeReady()
  );
}

const startPostgresContainer = () =>
  $`docker create --name ${containerName} ...`.then(() => {
    const postgresContainerProcess = $`docker start --attach ${containerName}`;

    return waitForContainerToBeReady().then(() => postgresContainerProcess);
  });

const stopPostgresContainer = (postgresContainerProcess: ProcessPromise) =>
  postgresContainerProcess.nothrow().kill();

startPostgresContainer((postgresContainerProcess) => {
  // Run some SQL queries and then stop the process
  return $`docker exec ...`.then(() =>
    stopPostgresContainer(postgresContainerProcess)
  );
});
```

The functions are neatly extracted so other scripts can use them easily and the
code consists of higher-level blocks, which makes it easier to read.

There is a bug in this code which is strictly related to the overloaded behavior
of `then`.

## Unnecessary waiting

The bug is in the final `then` of the `startPostgresContainer` function.

```typescript
const startPostgresContainer = () =>
  $`docker create --name ${containerName} ...`.then(() => {
    const postgresContainerProcess = $`docker start --attach ${containerName}`;

    return waitForContainerToBeReady().then(
      () =>
        // The bug is here üêõ
        postgresContainerProcess
    );
  });
```

The intent is to return the entire `postgresContainerProcess` of type
`ProcessPromise` (which is essentially `Promise<ProcessOutput>`) to the caller
of `startPostgresContainer`. What happens instead is that `then` **waits for**
the `postgresContainerProcess` to finish before resolving the outer promise
returned from `startPostgresContainer`. This means we have a deadlock, because
the `postgres` container will keep running in the background indefinitely and
the `zx` script will wait for it to finish.

This is strictly related to the fact that `then` will wait for the inner
`Promise` to resolve if it gets a `Promise` from the callback. It does not
support returning the inner Promise as the resolved `value` of the outer
Promise.

## Workarounds

There are 2 workarounds I found to this problem:

1. Separate creating processes from doing additional operations on them.

   This means a function like `startPostgresContainer` cannot both start the
   container and wait for it to be ready. It should only create the `Promise`
   and pass it to the caller. Then, the caller always gets the full `Promise`
   and can await it whenever they want. This means the calling code would have
   to be refactored like so:

   ```typescript
   startPostgresContainer((postgresContainerProcess) =>
     waitForContainerToBeReady()
       .then(() => $`docker exec ...`)
       .then(() => stopPostgresContainer(postgresContainerProcess))
   );
   ```

2. Wrap the inner `Promise` in an object or array to prevent `then` waiting for
   it.

   This is explicitly avoiding the _convenience_ of `then` by wrapping the inner
   `Promise` in some container (object/array), so `then` returns that container
   as-is rather than waiting for it to resolve before continuing.

   ```typescript
   const startPostgresContainer = () =>
     $`docker create --name ${containerName} ...`.then(() => {
       const postgresContainerProcess = $`docker start --attach ${containerName}`;

       return waitForContainerToBeReady().then(() =>
         // Notice we return an array now
         [postgresContainerProcess]
       );
     });

   startPostgresContainer(
     (
       // We unwrap that array in the consuming code
       [postgresContainerProcess]
     ) =>
       $`docker exec ...`.then(() =>
         stopPostgresContainer(postgresContainerProcess)
       )
   );
   ```

   A more contrived example:

   ```typescript
   import { $ } from "zx";

   const workflow = async () => {
     const sleep = $`sh -c "sleep 10 && echo Awoken from sleep"`;

     await $`echo "Hello world"`;
     return [sleep];
   };

   const [sleep] = await workflow();
   console.log("Killing sleeping process");
   await sleep.nothrow().kill();
   console.log("Done");
   ```

   Result:

   ```sh
   11:06 $ npx zx test.mjs
   $ sh -c "sleep 10 && echo Awoken from sleep"
   $ echo "Hello world"
   Hello world
   Killing sleeping process
   Done
   ```

I like the second solution better. It keeps the `waitForContainerToBeReady`
logic inside of `startPostgresContainer` while being only slightly less
convenient for the caller thanks to array destructuring.

## `async`/`await` is the same

In case you were wondering, using `async`/`await` instead of chaining `.then`
behaves the same way. If we rewrote `startPostgresContainer` to use async/await,
the bug would still be there:

```typescript
const startPostgresContainer = async () =>
  await $`docker create --name ${containerName} ...`
    const postgresContainerProcess = $`docker start --attach ${containerName}`;

    await waitForContainerToBeReady();
    return postgresContainerProcess;
  });
```

The `Promise` returned from `startPostgresContainer` would resolve when
`postgresContainerProcess` resolves. This means, `startPostgresContainer` would
resolve after the container process finishes.

[_Awaiting problems in JavaScript_](/article/awaiting-problems-in-javascript)
goes over this in more detail.

## Monadic chaining

In functional programming terminology, I would characterize `Promise` as a
slightly skewed monad. The overloaded `then` is the reason why it is _slightly
skewed_.

Monads have 2 separate methods to transform them:

- `map(callback)` which makes the outer monad contain whatever value the inner
  function returns. This is like `then` when the callback returns a regular
  value.
- `chain(callback)` (also known as `flatMap` or `bind`) which requires that the
  `callback` returns a monad, and the outer monad becomes that inner monad. This
  is like `then` when the callback returns another `Promise`.

What is nice in having 2 separate methods is that the programmer gets to choose
which one is needed at which point. Even if you decide to use the other one in
the middle of the function, changing the name from one to the other is simple
enough.

`then` does not let you choose - the behavior is chosen for you based on the
value you return. If you want the `map` functionality and want to return a
`Promise`, you are required to do workarounds.

If you are using [`fp-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/), you are in luck.
Its `Task` module contains separate
[`chain`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Task.ts.html#chain-1) and
[`map`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Task.ts.html#map) functions. If
you are using regular `Promise`s, you are stuck doing workarounds.

## Conclusion

`Promise` `then` API was designed in a way that differs from the usual
functional programming monad API. It offers more convenience in most cases, but
makes more advanced cases require workarounds. I appreciate precision and I
would love if the `Promise` API had 2 different methods for `chain` and `map`. I
doubt the core API will change, though, so this thought will stay an unfulfilled
dream.
