  My journey to using HiDPI in i3 and finally getting the full benefits of
  having a 4k monitor.
---

I am using [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as a Window Manager. I love the feeling of
being able to control everything via keyboard. Its tiling nature and easy access
to different workspaces is what makes me very comfortable in it. I started using
it in
[February 2021](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/commit/f1a79fca7cf4778bddf683770e862d8b68507349)
and enjoyed it since.

When starting remote work at [Splitgraph](https://www.splitgraph.com), I got 2
[Acer Nitro VG280K 28 inch 4k](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-VG280K-bmiipx-FreeSync-Technology/dp/B08VD89JMF)
monitors. They were quite an upgrade from my previous 22 inch 1080p monitors.

Immediately after connecting them to my laptop and using
[`xrandr`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xrandr) to initialize them

```sh
$ xrandr --output HDMI-0 --auto \
   --output DP-0 --auto --right-of HDMI-0

$ xrandr

I noticed a problem. The text was too small!

As outlined in
[this HackerNews comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25669793), text
rendered in a 4k resolution (3840x2160) is hard to read below 43 inches without
scaling. I can confirm that - the text was way too small for me at a distance I
was previously comfortable.

I switched to Windows and tried using it there. Windows immediately scaled up
the resolution by 150% but it was still using 4k. This made the text readable,
the interface large enough to use comfortably, and any content like videos on
YouTube were shown in 4k. The sweet spot.

I tried to do the same on my Ubuntu with i3. I failed. I was too much of an
Xorg/i3 newbie to follow all the instructions. All in all, I settled on using
2560x1440 as my resolution on both monitors. It made the text a bit blurry and
the videos were running in 1440p max (no 4k for me), but at least it was easy to
set up and it didn't require any custom scripts.

```sh
xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 2560x1440 \
  --output DP-0 --mode 2560x1440 --right-of HDMI-0
```

After 10 months of running my monitors in 1440p, I started tinkering around with
my i3/Xorg config to try to get [HiDPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI)
to work.

## Scale it up, then scale it down

I wanted to use 4k but scale the interface so it it has the readability of
1440p.

As I learned, the way to get HiDPI work in Xorg is as follows:

1. Set
   [`Xft.dpi: 192` in `~/.Xresources`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#X_Resources)

   192 means 200% scaling.

   This will make the interface twice as large.

   Starting i3 again after this step made the interface on my monitors the size
   of 1080p without scaling.

2. Use [`--scale` in `xrandr`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#Xorg) to
   change the resolution of the monitors.

   The value of `scale` needs to follow this equation:

   ```python
   monitor_resolution = 3840
   wanted_resolution = 2560
   dpi_scale = 2

   # wanted_resolution * dpi_scale = monitor_resolution * xrandr_scale
   xrandr_scale = wanted_resolution * dpi_scale / monitor_resolution
   xrandr_scale = 2560 * 2 / 3840
   xrandr_scale = 5120 / 3840
   xrandr_scale = 1.3333333333333
   ```

   This way I could initialize my monitor with

   ```sh
   xrandr --output HDMI-0 --auto --scale 1.33333333333x1.33333333333
   ```

   and, horray, it works as expected. The text is crisp, but the resolution is
   4k. In fact, the actual resolution that the graphics card has to render is
   even greater than 4k.

   ```sh
   $ xrandr
   # ...
   HDMI-0 connected primary 5120x2880+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 621mm x 341mm
   3840x2160     60.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
   # ...
   ```

3. Set `--panning` in `xrandr` to get the monitors side-by-side.

   Adding `--scale` to my second output and using `--right-of` in `xrandr`
   caused the screen to overlap - the second displayed a part of the first
   monitor's screen.

   I used the `--panning` option to tell `xrandr` precisely the range of pixels
   that I want each monitor show.

   ```sh
   xrandr --output HDMI-0 --auto --scale 1.33333333333x1.33333333333 \
     --output DP-0 --auto --scale 1.33333333333x1.33333333333 \
       --panning 5120x2880+5120+0
   ```

   The `+5120+0` tells `xrandr` that my `DP-0` (the right monitor) should be
   transated 5120px to the right. Thus, my first monitor renders horizontally
   pixels 0 - 5120, and my second monitor renders horizontally pixels
   5120 - 10240.

I created
[a script to run these operations](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/stowed/.screenlayout/home-4k/init-layout.sh).
I run that script each time i3 starts and I need to initialize the monitors.

## Other DPI-related changes

Most applications render well after just setting `Xft.dpi`. There were a couple
of places in my dotfiles that I had to change the font size, because it did not
scale with `Xft.dpi`:

- [i3 font size](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.config/i3/config#L6)
- [i3 bar font size](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.config/i3/config#L160)
- [rofi font size](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.config/rofi/config.rasi#L6)
- [GDK applications DPI](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.xinitrc#L4-L5)
  (see
  [GDK 3 section in the HiDPI guide](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#GDK_3_(GTK_3)>))
- [`Xcursor.size`](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.Xresources#L1)
- [dunst font size](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/stowed-templates/.config/dunst/dunstrc#L94)

## Regular DPI outside my home

I did not want to keep using HiDPI when I did not need it. This would negatively
impact battery life and generate excess heat by the graphics card, because it
would have to render 4 times as many pixels while offering no visual benefits.

I opted to use [gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate) to
dynamically generate the configuration that is dependent on DPI. I run
[the script to generate the config files based on the DPI](https://github.com/Gelio/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/6af492edccb7864ebcdbc098e1fe3a06f2f3e5b3/install/i3/templated-config/generate-config.sh)
before executing `startx`.

This way I can easily switch between HiDPI and normal DPI.

## Conclusion

HiDPI is supported when using i3. It requires more work to set up than in other
operating systems and is less seamless. I did not find a way to dynamically
change the scaling without exiting i3 and starting it again with updated
settings.

All in all, the support for scaling it pretty good and after setting it up, I
have not faced problems with it so far. Applications seems to work and scale
well.
