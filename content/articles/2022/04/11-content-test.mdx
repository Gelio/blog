title: Content test
date: 2022-04-11
tags: test, blog
slug: blog-content-test
summary: A test of various features of Markdown. I will add a longer
  sentence here and break it into multiple lines in the content source file
  to see how it is parsed and how it looks in the UI with some longer sentence.
  By the way, it should also support *Markdown* **right?**. `Yes`.

## Blog content test

This is a test of the blog's content. We will see how it renders.
This should be the same first paragraph.

> A quote.
> Multiline
>
> > With a nested quote
>
> ```ts
> const andA = "code block";
> ```

```ts
const regular = "code block";
```

Here comes [the Jekyll logo](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). <sup>I
picked it because it was the first image on a page I had open</sup>

![Jekyll logo](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png)

This should be enough.

I can also test foonotes[^1]
