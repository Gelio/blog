title: Type-safe nullability without strictNullChecks

summary:
  Lack of strictNullChecks makes it hard to express nullability of values.
  [fp-ts's `Option`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Option.ts.html)
  comes to the type-safe rescue.
---

TypeScript's
[`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks)
changes the assignability rules of `null` and `undefined`. They will no longer
be assignable to any value.

Compare the behavior for the following snippet with `strictNullChecks` enabled
([TS playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?strictNullChecks=false#code/CYUwxgNghgTiAEAzArgOzAFwJYHtVJxwAoA3KCZEALngGcMYtUBzAShpJy2AG4BYAFCDEhIqmQQIrHvAD0s+BhwZyEAJ5ImIIA))
and disabled
([TS playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/CYUwxgNghgTiAEAzArgOzAFwJYHtVJxwAoA3KCZEALngGcMYtUBzAShpJy2AG4BYAFCDEhIqmQQIrHvAD0s+BhwZyEAJ5ImIIA)):

```ts
declare function foo(value: string): void;

foo(null);
```

When that compiler options is turned off, TypeScript is fine with passing `null`
(or `undefined`) in any position, even if the type does not say that these
nullable values are allowed. This is rectified by enabling the option, which
produces a compilation error:

> Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.

Turning on that option in a TypeScript project is either all or nothing. There
is no easy way to enable it incrementally only for some part of the project
(although you can look at
[loose-ts-check](https://github.com/Gelio/loose-ts-check) which I wrote which
aims to allow this incremental approach). This makes code migrations hard.

What if we want to express nullability in a type-safe way while being
constrained to keep `strictNullChecks` disabled?

## fp-ts's Option to the rescue

One way to model nullability is with the fp-ts's
[`Option`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Option.ts.html) type. It
represents nullable values with
[the `None` object](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/8674480341fd0cf2847091a8daa6276d8e41f41e/src/Option.ts#L114-L116):

```ts
export interface None {
  readonly _tag: "None";
}
```

A defined value of type `A` is represented with
[the `Some<A>` object](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/8674480341fd0cf2847091a8daa6276d8e41f41e/src/Option.ts#L122-L125):

```ts
export interface Some<A> {
  readonly _tag: "Some";
  readonly value: A;
}
```

They are combined in
[a single `Option<A>` type union](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/8674480341fd0cf2847091a8daa6276d8e41f41e/src/Option.ts#L131):

```ts
export type Option<A> = None | Some<A>;
```

The rules are simple. If some value `T` is nullable, it should be represented as
`T`. Otherwise, if it is just the value `T`, we assume it is non-nullable.

## Example

Let's look at this example which prints a binary tree in order:

```ts
import { option } from "fp-ts";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/function";

interface TreeNode<T> {
  value: T;
  left: option.Option<TreeNode<T>>;
  right: option.Option<TreeNode<T>>;
}

function printTree(node: TreeNode<unknown>) {
  pipe(node.left, option.map(printTree));
  console.log(node.value);
  pipe(node.right, option.map(printTree));
}
```

You can clearly see which values the code expects to be nullable, and which are
required. We need to _unwrap_ the value from the `left` and `right` fields. We
cannot just use the value without checking if it is there. Let's compare that
with the code that uses `undefined` to express nullability (with
`strictNullChecks` still disabled):

```ts
interface TreeNode<T> {
  value: T;
  left: TreeNode<T> | undefined;
  right: TreeNode<T> | undefined;
}

function printTree(node: TreeNode<unknown>) {
  if (node.left) {
    printTree(node.left);
  }
  console.log(node.value);
  if (node.right) {
    printTree(node.right);
  }
}
```

If we forgot that `left` and `right` are nullable and used them without checking
if they are defined, we get a `TypeError` for trying to access `node.left` on an
`undefined` `node`:

```ts
function printTree(node: TreeNode<unknown>) {
  printTree(node.left); // will throw a TypeError
  console.log(node.value);
  printTree(node.right);
}
```

## Caveat

Using `Option` does not prevent passing `null` or `undefined` as any argument.
The code will still compile without errors because `strictNullChecks` are
disabled.

```ts
const treeNode: TreeNode<number> = {
  value: 1234,
  left: null, // should be option.none,
  right: undefined, // should be option.none,
};
```

The use of `Option` to express nullability is more of a hint to engineers. I
still believe it easier to use the `Option` type to say which fields are
nullable rather than have to learn it by heart, read through the code again if I
want to find it out, or produce bugs by not paying attention to nullability.

## Conclusion

fp-ts exposes an `Option` type which represents nullable values in a type-safe
way that hints to other engineers which values can be missing. We must first
check if the value is inside an `Option` to get access to it, which makes it
safe to use without having to remember whether a value is nullable. This is
particularly useful in TypeScript projects without `strictNullChecks` enabled.
