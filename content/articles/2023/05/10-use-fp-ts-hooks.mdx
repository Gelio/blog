summary:
  Using fp-ts containers in React hook dependency arrays is tricky since their
  references are not stable.
---

I love using [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) for its expressiveness
when using the [`Option`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html)
and [`Either`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html)
containers. I like the `Option` container in particular because it allows
[expressing nullability in a type-safe way](./type-safe-nullability-without-strictNullChecks)
in legacy TypeScript projects that have `strictNullChecks` disabled in their
`tsconfig.json`.

Working with these containers is usually pretty cheap. Determining whether an
`Either` is `Left` or `Right` or whether an `Option` is `Some` or `None` is
usually one `if` away (although you probably want to use other methods instead
of unwrapping these containers right away).

However, one difficult part is the lack of referential stability of these fp-ts
container values. This is particularly problematic with React hooks that use a
dependency array and strict equality to decide whether the dependencies changed.

Consider the following component
([TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzhMNgQHZwL5wGZQQhwBEeYAtDAM4kDcAsAFCiSyJxjBgCmO+hYmUo0A9HgCuGAMZpM9Zq2jwASjwCGsgDQcJ1HgGUY6mDx16eAYUymAHjHP6Aonjw9tcaVA2nrGO-C4BESk3powCkzM0pjU8ACq+lAY6iBWNjz2cAC8nmG+GfYAPHFQwBgA5nAAPnAYEgA2DQB8ABT1TQCUjFFMkjJyWIk8UAAKhHjADTyjwLIS3q2diMxwnrHwIOoAngBGPMPJqXy5KIMAdMEgAHKNDeq7060WfgGthylpr5kwnd2r6wwcTgAG0wBMpjM5jAFgcoA0dPoYOMIJNprN5t54vCALo5OAWIwmHhFAFrM7oDDnADyqEpJRgZUqzQBbQpmHOGEwPH+vTWFhcblkrSWOWaKyYazWwDwcFa7KpwGo125rS2ewOSU+POWCDJUu8MOSPSlOGY+piQPgD2Ur0ITRG+IwPAA7nAAIK7W02e3TKBLE1StwwaQAC1aAANRBYoKIACQIdX7D7Hc4AN3UDQkPGwEZ0eslprg1GAFRSDQAXHAbbA7RAHVBziWy5mtPrsJ19WtzjBQzwMCLvNRltlxUPzgAraiYJadwumnt9gfPJIj8UFotSpEotFQzFwhorkbnLj7gD6CwavM3HZ6+sNCywotH1a9tZ99b95xrMADAOwOggkmmojNqOK8gCD7JJw3A8K0+oKk2RBwUeRxpFWpTlBUa5ypeGGMlhOHwfOUpFKAVTUFA0jZAgl64JmMA0RGCYxtquDgqikIwfuEa4KILIkX8bYkYh6hgGqOzJlqxydMJpqieJHG7hiRoHrJCF0hyFQ8DA1JQE4DT6CKOEdFeAK8tgzBAA)):

```tsx
import { option } from "fp-ts";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/function";
import React, { useState, useContext, useEffect, createContext } from "react";

const UsernameContext = createContext<string | null>(null);

function UserProfilePicture() {
  const maybeUsername = option.fromNullable(useContext(UsernameContext));
  const [profilePictureUrl, setProfilePictureUrl] = useState<
    option.Option<string>
  >(option.none);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (option.isNone(maybeUsername)) {
      return;
    }

    const abortController = new AbortController();
    fetch(`/user/${maybeUsername.value}`, {
      signal: abortController.signal,
    })
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((user) => {
        setProfilePictureUrl(user.picture_url);
      });

    return () => abortController.abort();
  }, [maybeUsername]);

  return pipe(
    option.some((username: string) => (url: string) => (
      <img src={url} alt={`${username} profile picture`} />
    )),
    option.ap(maybeUsername),
    option.ap(profilePictureUrl),
    option.getOrElse(() => null)
  );
}
```

It seems well, except for the fact that it will keep rerunning the effect and
sending requests on each rerender. The culprit? `option.fromNullable` which
creates a new `Some<A>` object each time it is called with a defined value.
This, in turn, is fed into the `useEffect` dependency array, which makes it run
the effect again, even if the inner value inside the `Option` is still the same.

This is a risk stemming from creating new `Either`s and `Option`s on the fly.
Their references are not stable. They will create new objects each time.

## Workarounds

Not all is lost. While we wait for
[the auto-memoizing React compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc),
we can still use some workarounds for this problem.

### Memoize the call to `option.fromNullable`

If we change

```ts
const maybeUsername = option.fromNullable(useContext(UsernameContext));
```

to

```ts
const unsafeUsername = useContext(UsernameContext);
const maybeUsername = useMemo(
  () => option.fromNullable(unsafeUsername),
  [unsafeUsername]
);
```

then the `Option` itself will remain the same object in memory as long as the
`unsafeUsername` remains the same.

This works, but has a downside of leaking the `unsafeUsername` variable in the
current scope.

### Use specialized fp-ts React hooks

[fp-ts-react-stable-hooks](https://github.com/mblink/fp-ts-react-stable-hooks)
is a library exposing fp-ts-aware React hooks. One of them is `useStableEffect`
for which we define an [`Eq`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Eq.ts.html)
(equality rules) that will be used to compare the dependency arrays:

```ts
useStableEffect(
  () => {
    // The body of the effect is unchanged
    // ...
  },
  [maybeUsername],
  eq.tuple(option.getEq(eq.eqStrict))
);
```

The constructed `Eq` will compare the `maybeUsername` from dependency arrays and
determine if they meaningfully differ (one is `Some` and the other is `None`, or
both are `Some` with different inner values).

#### Automatically creating an fp-ts-aware `Eq`

Looking at `fp-ts-react-stable-hooks` I had an idea. Hand-writing these `Eq`
implementations is surely error-prone and cumbersome. There must be a way to
automatically create an `Eq` implementation based on the dependency array. It
would meaningfully compare `Option`s and `Either`s (compare their contents) and
use strict equality comparisons for other values.

I created
[`optionEitherAwareEq`](https://github.com/Gelio/use-fp-ts-hooks/blob/127c834135d2a82c2d6e3b360ef63a657770c053/src/index.ts#L61)
that does exactly that. While it seems to work well
([the tests](https://github.com/Gelio/use-fp-ts-hooks/blob/127c834135d2a82c2d6e3b360ef63a657770c053/src/index.test.ts#L5)
pass), it has some downsides:

- it inspects the dependency array to decide which `Eq` to use for each item.
  This could be costly, especially since this is done on each render.
- it assumes the order of elements in the dependency array is always the same.

I decided not to publish this library, since it could be harmful to the premise
of memoization of these values. It is sound, meaning it will correctly
meaningfully compare dependency arrays, but it may be slow. Use it at your own
risk.

## Rant: JavaScript lacks built-in meaningful equality checks

In Rust, there is
[an `Eq` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html) that is a core
concept of the language. Each type can decide how it wants to be compared with
other types (and itself) by implementing the `PartialEq` trait.

```rust
enum MyOption<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

impl<T> PartialEq for MyOption<T>
where
    T: PartialEq,
{
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        match (self, other) {
            (MyOption::None, MyOption::None) => true,
            (MyOption::Some(a), MyOption::Some(b)) => a == b,
            _ => false,
        }
    }
}

impl<T: Eq> Eq for MyOption<T>{}

fn main() {
    let a = MyOption::Some(1234);
    let b = MyOption::Some(1234);

    println!("{:?}", a == b)
}
```

[Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=bef1666b1b831547da8424d7ed16c260)

There is no concept like `Eq` in JavaScript. Types like `Option` are simple
objects which do not have a notion of equality associated with them. If a
library (like React) receives an unknown value, the best it can do to compare it
with some other value is to use `===` (strict equality) or
[`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)
(which it does).

This is unfortunate. I do not see an easy way to solve this problem without a
fundamental JavaScript rework to be more aware of types.

## Conclusion

Constructing fp-ts containers like `Option` and `Either` on the fly in the
render cycle poses risks when these are used in dependency arrays. These values
need to be stable so effects do not re-execute after each rerender.
