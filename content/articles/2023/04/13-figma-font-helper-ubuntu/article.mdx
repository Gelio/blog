summary:
  Figma does not officially support local filesystem fonts on Linux. However,
  there is an open-source tool that makes it possible.
---

Figma allows using local filesystem fonts in design files. This expands the
existing library of preset fonts ([Google Web Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/))
with the ones you have installed locally on your computer.

It is great if you are using some font that is not available on Google Web
Fonts. It works well until a user who does not have that font installed tries to
edit some text that is using a local font. Figma will not make it possible (even
though the text is rendered just fine).

replace those missing fonts with some existing and available
font.](/static-content/2023/04/13-figma-font-helper-ubuntu/before-installing-fonts-server.png)

This feature requires using the Figma desktop app, or installing a tool that
exposes local fonts to the Figma web app in the browser. According to
[the Figma documentation about using local fonts](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894-Access-local-fonts-on-your-computer),
these are only available on Windows and Mac.

What about Linux users? They cannot use the official solution. This is where
open-source shines.
[figma-linux-font-helper](https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux-font-helper)
is an open-source server written in Rust that exposes local fonts, the same way
that the official Figma tools do.

It binds itself to 127.0.0.1:18412 and responds to Figma web app's requests for
`/figma/font-files` and `/figma/font-file`.

After installing the `figma-linux-font-helper`, Figma connects to it and
correctly fetches some local fonts which it complained about being local before.

fonts.](/static-content/2023/04/13-figma-font-helper-ubuntu/figma-localhost-requests.png)

![Figma dialog informing the user about missing local fonts. This time it lists
only a handful of fonts which are not installed locally. Other ones were served
correctly and using them in Figma is
possible.](/static-content/2023/04/13-figma-font-helper-ubuntu/after-installing-fonts-server.png)

This way I can finally edit text on mockups prepared by UX designers which were
using local fonts ðŸŽ‰
