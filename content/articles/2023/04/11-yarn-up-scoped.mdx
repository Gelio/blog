`yarn up '*'` upgrades only unscoped packages.

Scoped packages are those that start with `@` and have 2 parts (the scope and
the name) separated with a slash, e.g. `@types/node`.

To upgrade scoped packages, use `yarn up '*/*'`.

Make sure to surround the argument with quotes so it does not undergo
[shell filename expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html).

## Reason

[`yarn up` uses the `parseDescriptor` function](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/cb2eecc859145235dcab6e338b264069c64ba027/packages/plugin-essentials/sources/commands/up.ts#L188)
to parse the patterns from the command line arguments. It parses the argument
and
[sets the scope to `null` if it is not provided](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/cb2eecc859145235dcab6e338b264069c64ba027/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/structUtils.ts#L397-L399).

In the case of just `*`, the descriptor's `name` will be parsed to `*`, but the
`scope` will be set to `null`. This targets only unscoped packages.
