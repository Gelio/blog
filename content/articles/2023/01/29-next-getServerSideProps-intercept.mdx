title: Next.js getServerSideProps interception

summary:
  Next.js can seem stuck fetching `getServerSideProps` result on client-side
  navigations. The approach outlined in the article bypasses making that network
  request, resulting in snappier UI, suitable for highly-interactive web
  applications.

When a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) page has
[`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
defined, Next will always fetch it before rendering the page. This happens even
if it was fetched already. While it is nice to have the assurance that the page
will always show the most up-to-date information, this behavior does not suit
highly-interactive web applications which need instant feedback on navigation.
The problem is exacerbated when `getServerSideProps` takes a long time to return
the data.

This behavior can be circumvented on a per-route basis. We need to hook into the
Next router and lie to it that a given page does not have `getServerSideProps`.
Next will assume that it does not need to make that network request and will
instead render the page. It is up to the page component to render previous data
in that case or show a loading indicator while loading the data it would have
otherwise received from `getServerSideProps`.

The main idea behind this interception is implemented in the following
`useNextServerSidePropsInterception` hook
([source code](https://github.com/Gelio/next-intercept-ssr-navigation/blob/main/src/intercept-getServerSideProps.ts),
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Gelio/next-intercept-ssr-navigation),
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/Gelio/next-intercept-ssr-navigation),
[demo page](https://next-intercept-ssr-navigation.vercel.app/)).

```typescript
export const useNextServerSidePropsInterception = ({
  enabled,
}: {
  enabled: boolean;
}) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // NOTE: remove existing information about the /pizza route
    // so Next does not "remember" whether it had getServerSideProps or not
    // @see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/13b32ba98179aa94ac2e402f272e5c6a3356d310/packages/next/src/shared/lib/router/router.ts#L971
    delete SingletonRouter.router?.components["/pizza"];

    if (!enabled) {
      return;
    }

    const pageLoader = SingletonRouter.router?.pageLoader;
    if (!pageLoader) {
      return;
    }

    const { loadPage: originalLoadPage } = pageLoader;

    // NOTE: intercept `loadPage` calls to prevent fetching Next data when
    // navigating to some pages
    // @see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9c6d56122bfe7cc6aef066cad88ee477a60a340a/packages/next/src/client/page-loader.ts#L155-L169
    pageLoader.loadPage = async (...args) => {
      return originalLoadPage.apply(pageLoader, args).then((pageCache) => ({
        ...pageCache,
        mod: {
          ...pageCache.mod,
          // NOTE: behave as if there is no `getServerSideProps` for the
          // page so Next won't fetch the result from the server
          // @see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9c6d56122bfe7cc6aef066cad88ee477a60a340a/packages/next/src/shared/lib/router/router.ts#L2165
          __N_SSP: false,
        },
      }));
    };

    return () => {
      pageLoader.loadPage = originalLoadPage;
    };
  }, [enabled]);
};
```

The main idea is to disable `__N_SSP` for a specific page. This lets Next know
that it does not need to fetch the result of `getServerSideProps` by having
[`shouldFetchData` equal to `false`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/9c6d56122bfe7cc6aef066cad88ee477a60a340a/packages/next/src/shared/lib/router/router.ts#L2165).

We also need to wipe cached `__N_SSP` information in
`SingletonRouter.router.components` for pages we care about. This is only
relevant if you enable this interception conditionally. If it is always enabled
for some pages, the `delete` call is unnecessary.

The code above will disable fetching `getServerSideProps` for all pages. When
used in your app, you probably want to add some condition to the monkey-patched
`loadPage` so it only bypasses the requests on some routes that you care about.

When the `getServerSideProps` interception is enabled, the `/pizza` page will
show:

- a loading indicator, and start loading the data in the background, if it is
  the first time the user is visiting the site,
- previous results, if the page was visited by the user before.

## Why not remove `getServerSideProps`

We could remove `getServerSideProps` to achieve similar in-browser data-fetching
behavior. However, such a page would become a static site and would not include
the data in the server-sent HTML. It would likely hurt SEO, as the data would be
only available for clients with JavaScript enabled, and only after the page is
loaded.

## Streaming in Next `app/` directory

This problem of having loading indicator during navigation could be solved by
using
[React Streaming](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/streaming-and-suspense).
It [is available](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap) in the
Next `app` directory.

The solution shown above is for pages that still use the Next `pages` directory
and `next/router`.
