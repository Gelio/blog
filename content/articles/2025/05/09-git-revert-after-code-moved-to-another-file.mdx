summary: How to do `git revert` after the code has been moved to another file
---

## TL;DR

1. `git show -R <commit> > revert.patch` to generate a reverse patch
2. `patch <file> revert.patch` to apply the patch to the correct file (the one
   where the code was moved to)

## Reverting a commit

`git revert` undoes changes done in some earlier commit. It assumes the files
are still in the same place, and the code has not been moved around.

```sh
$ git commit -m "feat: risky feature"
[main e86576e] feat: risky feature
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

$ git revert HEAD --no-edit
[main b0eb58b] Revert "feat: risky feature"
 Date: Fri May 9 21:26:20 2025 +0200
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

$ git log -n 1
commit b0eb58b496ac695bc33a1f03d4363da56692ed28
Author: Grzegorz Rozdzialik <voreny.gelio@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 9 21:26:20 2025 +0200

    Revert "feat: risky feature"

    This reverts commit e86576e2db771f7f4898be48590f98b841babee9.
```

What if you want to revert an earlier commit, and the code has been moved to
another file in the meantime?

## Reverting after a file was renamed

If the entire file was moved, then git will most likely be smart enough to
notice that was a file rename/move (notice the `rename` in the `git commit`
output below), and it will `git revert` will work just fine.

```sh
$ git commit -m "chore: move journal"
[main 6dbc8f9] chore: move journal
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename journal.txt => journal-2.tx (100%)

$ git revert HEAD~ --no-edit
[main e30fd93] Revert "feat: risky feature"
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Dealing with moved code

Problems happen when only part of the code was moved, e.g. when a file was
sliced and some code was extracted. Then, git will not know what to do, and
`git revert` will refuse to work.

```sh
$ git revert HEAD~
Auto-merging Header.tsx
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Header.tsx
error: could not revert 8409ca0... refactor: change styles
hint: After resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add/rm <pathspec>", then run
hint: "git revert --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit with "git revert --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git revert",
hint: run "git revert --abort".

$ git diff
diff --cc Header.tsx

The output is pretty unhelpful. It tries to revert the change, but the code is
no longer there.

I know that I moved the code to `StyledIconLink.tsx`. I would love to tell
`git revert` to try to apply that revert patch not to `Header.tsx`, but to
`StyledIconLink.tsx`. The way to do that is to:

1. Generate a reverse patch (e.g. using `git show -R`)
2. Apply that patch manually to the correct file using `patch`

```sh
$ git show -R HEAD~ > revert.patch
$ patch StyledIconLink.tsx revert.patch
patching file StyledIconLink.tsx
No such line 37 in input file, ignoring
1 out of 2 hunks failed--saving rejects to StyledIconLink.tsx.rej
```

The `patch` command:

- reverted as much of `StyledIconLink.tsx` as it could

  ```sh
  $ git diff
  diff --git a/StyledIconLink.tsx b/StyledIconLink.tsx
  index d95a425..f8e0e1d 100644
  --- a/StyledIconLink.tsx

     },
   }));
  ```

- said that it could not revert everything, and reported that in
  `StyledIconLink.tsx.rej` - makes sense, because that commit changed code
  outside of `StyledIconLink.tsx` as well. This shows which other code I need to
  revert manually.

  ```sh
  $ cat StyledIconLink.tsx.rej

      +          aria-label="My GitHub profile"
      >
      <GitHubIcon />
      </StyledIconLink>
  ```

- created a `StyledIconLink.tsx.orig` file with the original contents of the
  file (pre-patch). This is most likely pointless, because you are already using
  git, so you can easily go back to the original content of
  `StyledIconLink.tsx`.

## Switcheroo: generate a normal patch, and patch in reverse

Instead of tucking the `-R` flag to the `git show` command, you can also add it
to the `patch` command:

```sh
git show HEAD~ > normal.patch
patch -R StyledIconLink.tsx normal.patch
```

This has the same effect. Choose whichever you prefer.
